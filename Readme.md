# Domino Game 

# Overview
The **Domino Game** written in C#, is designed to arrange a given set of dominos into a circular chain where:
- Domino matching is considered when the left part of a domino matches with the right part of another domino
- and a chain is considered when dominoes matching in a list and the first domino's left value should match with the last domino's right value.

If a chain is not possible, the program outputs an appropriate message.
